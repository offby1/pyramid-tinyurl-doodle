Notes for someone who never uses docker!

To build the docker thingy, type `docker build .`

Note the blob of hex that it prints when its finished; let's say it was "deadbeef".

To run a shell in the (image? container?), type

    docker run --interactive --tty deadbeef bash

Note that you always have to hit C-p _twice_ to look at your previous command-line history entry; dunno why.

To start the thing up "normally":

    docker run
