# WASSUP HOMIES

Rewrote it in Django.

Uses sqlite instead of dynamodb:

* django doesn't work well with dynamodb (or any nosql database);
* sqlite otta be fine given how little data we have

    As of 2024-07-01T08:09:41-0700:

    ```text
    Item count
    10,689
    Table size
    2.2 megabytes
    Average item size
    204.17 bytes
    ```

  We will back up sqlite by having "cron" or "systemd" or whatever run `python manage.py sync-ddb-data` every now and then.  Or, you know, I'll just run that when I think of it :-)

  I have another management command, `backup-db-to-s3`, that isn't needed any more, but I feel like keeping it around for some reason.

## No, really; wassup

Despite all my recent hackage around Docker, I'm *really* trying to understand Nginx. I don't expect to use Docker in production; rather, it's a convenient way to run nginx locally while I figure out how to configure it.

I'm already using nginx in production, to do SSL termination (I know of no better way (although I've heard good things about [traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/))).

If I'm lucky and clever, I'll be able to run the master branch *and* this branch in production at the same time, with the same nginx instance, but with two different sets of config.  Ideally, I'd eventually decide this branch is awesome, and will just shut down the other branch and remove its config.

## How to get it all going

### prod

I did these on Ubuntu "24.04 LTS (Noble Numbat)"

As root:

```shell
yes '' | adduser --disabled-password --quiet teensy
DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt install -y git nginx snapd python3-poetry
```

- `su - teensy`

```shell
mkdir ~/shorty
cd ~/shorty
git clone https://gitlab.com/offby1/teensy.git .
mkdir -vp ~/.config/info.teensy.teensy-django
cat > ~/.config/info.teensy.teensy-django/.env
exit # back to root
```

- Now paste the env file:
  - grab the `RECAPTCHA_SECRET` from <https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#site/320420908>, log in as me, click the gear, click the "reCAPTCHA keys" thing, click "copy secret key"
  - generate `SECRET_KEY` with `python3  -c 'import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(100))'`
  In a perfect world, if you're moving the site from one host to another, you'd use the same SECRET_KEY on both, since I think that means that auth tokens would then transfer over.  But on the other hand, the only person who needs to authenticate is me, so ... ðŸ¤·

- `cat > /etc/systemd/system/teensy.service`

Then paste the file of that name from this directory

```shell
snap install lego
lego --email="eric.hanchrow@gmail.com" --domains="teensy.com" --http run
```
  - scrape generated cert and key outta wherever they wound up, and plop 'em in `/etc/pki/nginx`, where the config looks for it
  - yeah this should probably all be a recipe (or recipes) in the justfile

## TODO

* [ ] Set up cron job to run `sync-ddb-data`, as above.
   `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.prod_settings nice  ~/git-repos/me/teensy-django/.venv/bin/python manage.py sync-ddb-data` will probably do it.
## DONE

* [x] figure out how to deal with Docker secrets

  <https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/#build-support-for-docker-secrets-into-your-images> suggests it's straightforwardâ€”and in fact I've done something similar in the `docker-take-three` branch.  It's confusing, though, since much of the documentation around docker secrets refers to "docker swarm", which is ... I dunno? An alternative to docker-compose?
* [x] Go through [the nginx beginner's guide](http://nginx.org/en/docs/beginners_guide.html) slowly and carefully
  Not very informative, as it happens :-|
* [x] plop it on an actual EC2 box and test it in "production" mode.
  In particular: the recaptcha
* [x] Come up with a better django admin password, and a better mechanism for getting it onto the prod host
  The password is now in bitwarden and Firefox.  The "better mechanism" is just running `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=project.prod_settings poetry run python manage.py changepassword ubuntu` at the command line.
* [x] Tell Google not to index the site
* [x] Tweak gunicorn logging so it puts the actual IP address in the log, not `127.0.0.1`
* [x] Again look into replacing `runme.sh` with ["just"](https://just.systems/man/en/)
* [x] Consider [whitenoise](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of a special section for nginx
* [x] Test with rudybot!
  Pretty sure I need to whitelist its IP address.
  A recent log against the pyramid server looks like `144.217.82.212 - - [14/Jul/2024:19:09:16 +0000] "GET /shorten-/?input_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmy.what.a.long.url%2Fyou%2Fhave%2Fgrandma%2Fmy.what.a.long.url%2Fyou%2Fhave%2Fgrandma%2Fmy.what.a.long.url%2Fyou%2Fhave%2Fgrandma%2Fmy.what.a.long.url%2Fyou%2Fhave%2Fgrandma%2F HTTP/1.1" 200 30 "-" "Racket/7.9 (net/http-client)"` fwiw
* [x] Update the nginx.conf again, to have just one server
* [x] Figure out why my old "teensy-2022" host died :-|
  tl;dr: `StartLimitAction=reboot` ðŸ¤¢
  All I remember:
  - I was fiddling the `teensy.service` file, and did something like `sudo systemctl start teensy` to start it
  - systemctl said something like "golly I noticed some config files have changed; please do `systemctl daemon-reload the world` or something
  - from that point on it was weirdly unresponsive -- CPU usage went to about 60%, and I couldn't ssh in
  - perhaps attach that old root disk to the new host, and poke around in the logs
* [x] Update the systemd file.
