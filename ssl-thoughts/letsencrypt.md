A while ago I tried letsencrypt, specifically "certbot", and found it overwhelmingly complex (despite the web page's describing it as simple).

Apparently there are other ways of getting a cert from letsencrypt; [this one](https://github.com/kshcherban/acme-nginx) is designed for nginx so might be usable.
