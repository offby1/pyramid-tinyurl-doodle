-   This site is unusable on my phone -- it's too teeny.  Some ideas for
    "responsive design":

    - [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design)
    - Google: [this](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/?hl=en)
      might be OK
    - Some dude on #python suggested http://www.johnmorrisonline.com/use-media-queries-build-responsive-web-site/

- The long URLs in the "Recent entries" table can get mighty long! I
  should probably truncate them.
